This is our very first robotics competition experience.

* Our robot did not do well in the first attempt.
* The reason was that, the speed of our robot was a littlebit much for taking some of the turns in the arena.
* Then we were allowed to change the speed but with a penalty.
* After redducing the speed, our robot did it's job pretty well.

Feedback

* 3D modeling and realworld modeling (including modeling physics) of the robot and the sensors was very good. 
* Our algorithms were appreciated and told us some good coding practices for follow in the future competetions.

This discussion is only for the purpose of remembering us, how we did in the competetion. We think as a team, our achievement is more than enough, in our very first robotics competition.
